# symbi-spoof-site (Forensic Mirror)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository is **not a legitimate SYMBI product**. It is a cloned instance of a suspicious or potentially malicious web asset, hosted here **strictly for analysis and security research**.

## üö® Purpose

This repo exists to:
- Enable static/dynamic analysis of potentially malicious or spoofed code.
- Investigate Bitcoin/EVM wallet injection or address replacement techniques.
- Track and attribute suspicious activity tied to embedded wallet addresses, ENS names, or developer identities.
- Collaborate with AI tools like Copilot, Codex, and SYMBI for deep inspection.

## üì¶ Contents

- `btc.js` ‚Äî Script containing a hardcoded Bitcoin wallet address.
- `evmAsk.js` ‚Äî Sends user input and wallet info to an external API endpoint.
- `js` ‚Äî Binds chain selection to UI output (potentially deceptive address injection).
- Other files ‚Äî Stored exactly as retrieved, **not modified**, and retained for evidence and analysis only.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

- These files were **not authored by me**.
- They were downloaded from a suspected spoof or impersonation website and uploaded **only for security research and AI-based static review**.
- **DO NOT DEPLOY** or reuse this code for any production or public-facing application.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

- Repo will likely be made **private** once AI/CoPilot review is complete.
- Do **not fork** or reuse this without full context.
- Any addresses, emails, or identities found are being investigated for attribution or abuse.

## üß† Owner Note

This repo is maintained by **@s8ken**, with the goal of leveraging AI tools (Codex, SYMBI, Copilot) to uncover threats, protect users, and trace intent behind unauthorized spoof sites.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Status: UNDER INVESTIGATION
